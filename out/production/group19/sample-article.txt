A calm prevailed before the firestorm.

Canada awaited the start of wildfire season. It was the end of April. The annual battle of the blazes was not expected to begin in earnest for weeks, maybe even two months in a good year. But it would soon become clear that the 2023 season would be anything but good.

On April 30, the first “wildfire of note”—meaning it could threaten public safety or critical infrastructure—popped up in Alberta. About an hour’s drive west of the capital city of Edmonton, near the hamlet of Entwistle, a fire devoured tinderbox-dry trees and grass. A few minutes away, a second wildfire of note burned simultaneously. This one cropped up closer to the hamlet of Evansburg, humorously known for electing a “town grouch” in past years. There was nothing funny, however, about what was about to occur: Something had sparked Alberta’s first two notable fires of the year, igniting a wildfire season across Canada unlike any other.

The blazes became a fiery harbinger, foreshadowing a season eventually described as vicious, hellish, and apocalyptic. One word, however, emerged from the lexicon of forestry experts as the defining characteristic of the 2023 Canadian wildfire season: unprecedented.

Simply put, the nation experienced “catastrophic fire activity,” said Yan Boulanger, a research scientist at the Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada. “This fire season has been marked by extreme fire weather conditions driven by record high temperatures and widespread drought conditions across the nation,” Boulanger said. It was “the most devastating fire season in recent memory, by far.”

By the end of September, the amount of Canadian forest lost to destructive flames sat at 18 million hectares (44.4 million acres). That represents an area bigger than 140 of the world’s countries. It’s also about six times greater than the average amount of land lost to fire in an entire season in Canada. Frighteningly, the season was still a few weeks away from being over, with more than 480 fires still burning out of control when that tally was made.

“This is a scary time for a lot of people from coast to coast to coast,” said Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, alluding to the vastness of a nation on fire, stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans and upward into Canada’s north.

Tens of thousands of Canadians had faced evacuation orders and been chased from their homes by flames —some with only their kids, their pets, and the clothes on their backs. They anxiously awaited news in a haze-filled limbo, hoping for permission to return home and dreading the outcome that hundreds faced: They no longer had a home to go to.

“The stress of leaving your home, not knowing if it will be there when you return, is a reality now faced by thousands,” said Harjit Sajjan, the federal Minister of Emergency Preparedness. “It is during these dark times that we see our country come together.”

Wildfire warnings arrived from a myriad of forestry and government agencies, as a hot, dry spring gave way to an even hotter, drier summer. Dozens of communities sat on the verge of fire disaster, with unrelenting heat baking the boreal forest.

“This weather event has the potential to be the most challenging 24 to 48 hours of the summer from a fire perspective,” Cliff Chapman, director of wildlife operations with the BC Wildfire Service, said at one point. “If there was ever a time to make sure you have an evacuation plan for you and your family, it’s now. If ever there was a time to make sure you have a grab-and-go bag, it is now.”

His words fit the narrative of the wildfire season. Never before had Canada seen this many wildfires that were this large, this intense, and this fast. The superlatives stacked up as flames gutted forests across almost all of Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories throughout the summer. Some provinces recorded the largest wildfires they had ever experienced. Others recorded more fires than ever before. Still others saw fires travel at unparalleled speeds.

Just how unprecedented was Canada’s 2023 fire season? Well, the wildfire destruction was off the charts— literally.

Officials whose job is to track wildfires needed to create new charts to show the dramatic increase in land lost to fire in 2023. With more than a quarter of the fire season still left, 6,230 wildfires had roared across the country by September 10. In 2022, there were 4,883 such fires in the entire year.

The intensity of the fires shocked many Canadians, too. British Columbia experienced a rare “firenado” — a whirling vortex of flames that sucks in debris. Evacuees across the country reported that the heat of wildfires peeled paint off their vehicles as they dashed for safety. Fires burned so deep in parts of the forest that they left roots exposed, leaving trees with an other-worldly appearance of being suspended in air. And no structure in the path of a wicked wildfire was safe — including the firehall that became engulfed in flames in the town of Scotch Creek, B.C., or the homes of 13 firefighters who battled to save their tiny community of Wilson’s Landing, B.C., while their own houses were gutted.

The 2023 wildfire season was indeed unparalleled, said the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), a non-profit corporation owned by Canada’s federal, provincial, and territorial wildland fire-management agencies.

“What has demarcated this season is that we had significant fire activity in different places simultaneously and that has really made for some challenging conditions,” said Jennifer Kamau, CIFFC communications manager.

Each wildfire season, CIFFC monitors the country’s fire activity, the availability of firefighting resources, and the demand for those resources. The organization then gives the country a rating of 1 (the best-case scenario) to 5 (the most critical scenario) on a national preparedness level. In spring 2023 , it moved Canada to a 5 very early in the season, on May 12. The country remained on that highest level of alert all summer. While hitting a Level 5 isn’t rare, the duration for which Canada sat at this level is, said Kamau. A Level 5, she explained, means “there’s significant fire activity in one or more jurisdictions; that firefighters and equipment in Canada have all been put to use; and that we’ve requested international help.”

Canada, indeed, needed help.

Lost in the turmoil of wildfire destruction is the fact that fire exists as a natural part of the ecosystem. It eliminates dead trees, turns past-its-prime organic material into ash, and opens up swaths of ground, allowing new life to access nutrients from the soil and restart the cycle of forest life. While lightning is often a precursor to such events, forest-management folks also use controlled or prescribed burns to foster vegetation development and get rid of any worrisome build-ups of fuel. Careless human behaviour can also be a cause of these conflagrations.

While the causes of wildland fires can vary, climate conditions can also provide the setting that allows a spark to become a flame. And in 2023 across much of Canada, those conditions were a drought-fraught danger. Winter snowfall had been weak; the spring runoff was bleak. Rivers meandered instead of rushed. Rainfall was light, but the sun was bright. May temperatures skyrocketed to blistering highs more often seen in the middle of summer than in the early days of spring. Canada’s forests withered. Parched conditions left woodlands vulnerable to the slightest spark. In April, wildfires started popping up across the country. By May 4, things began to look alarming, starting with Alberta, where the prairies roll west to greet mountains and forest. An astounding 44 wildfires started that day, bringing the fire count to 72. Within 24 hours, that number rose to 92 — and one-third of those fires were out of control.

Residents in hamlets, villages, towns, and First Nations communities got word: Leave! Fire was headed their way. Within the month, dozens of communities declared states of emergency or dealt with evacuation orders. More than 19,000 worried souls took to the highways, looking for safe refuge, as flames licked the edges of their vehicles.

“It was a sight of doomsday,” said one Alberta evacuee, Lyla Sleno.

Volatility continued for weeks, with the province reaching its most destructive season on record for wildfires — 1.7 million hectares (4.2 million acres) scorched by almost 900 fires — with at least two months of the wildfire season still remaining.

Fires sparked in most other provinces and territories, too, including the Northwest Territories, Yukon, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick. But it was Nova Scotia that grabbed the most headlines as May drew to a close. Two intense fires ripped through the province of lighthouses and lobster.

“All hell is breaking loose,” Halifax Fire District chief Rob Hebb said at the time. The Barrington Lake fire in the southern portion of Nova Scotia grew to become the largest wildfire the province had ever seen — twice as big as anything else ever experienced there. A second major fire invaded the province’s most populated area — the Halifax Regional Municipality — leading approximately 18,000 people to evacuate their homes. In the end, more than 300 homes and structures were lost to flames between the two fires.

As May drew to a close, fire statistics were grim. The Canadian land scorched by wildfires had already reached the annual average — and the wildfire season was just beginning.

The world watched Canada’s growing infernos. Firefighters from around the globe, ultimately from a dozen countries and numbering more than 5,000, began arriving to assist the frontline heroes trying to save the forests and, in many cases, their neighbours’ homes and businesses.

The world paid attention for another reason, too. Wildfire smoke, which had choked much of Canada for the past month, began curling its acrid fingers around American states and even reaching out across the Atlantic Ocean to dim skies over Portugal, Spain, France and the United Kingdom.

June brought more fires, in Ontario and particularly in Quebec. In an average year, “la belle province” would see only 247 hectares (610 acres) consumed by flames by June 5. But, this year, that number had exploded to a shocking 158,000 hectares (390,000 acres) by the same date — more than 600 times greater than usual. All that fire began emitting a health-hazardous haze that moved southward.

“Particularly noteworthy within the intensive protection zone (the area where normally all fires are fought) is that the timeframe between June 1 and June 20 witnessed more land consumed by fire than the cumulative sum of the preceding 20 years,” said research scientist Yan Boulanger. “These fires have produced dense smoke plumes, triggering air quality alerts across densely populated areas of Canada . . . and the northern United States; and the consequences have even crossed the Atlantic, casting hazy skies over Western Europe.”

In the United States, the smoke hung heavy, with many American cities setting records for their worst air quality ever.

The smoke presented a health hazard everywhere from Minnesota and Indiana to the Mid-Atlantic, East Coast and the South. Tabloid newspapers shouted their concern with headlines such as “Blame Canada.”

An estimated 123 million Americans received health warnings about poor-quality air due to the Canadian smoke. Residents were cautioned to stay inside when possible or wear protective masks. Elderly people and those with frail health received warnings to avoid the smoke at all costs. The smoke led to hazy skies, sometimes cast in an other-worldly orange glow, while organizers cancelled everything from kids’ camps to sporting and cultural events. When smoke migrated south again in July, an estimated 70 million people in 32 states were affected. The impacts of Canadian wildfires continued to spread.

Those impacts became deadly. A nine-year-old Canadian boy, who suffered from asthma his entire life, died after having an asthma attack. Medical examiners investigated the death as being caused by a condition aggravated by wildfire smoke.

On the front lines of fires, the toll on firefighters grew heavier, too, as four perished in July while doing the job they loved. Devyn Gale, 19, died when a tree fell on her while she tackled a blaze near Revelstoke, B.C. Adam Yeadon, 25, was also fatally injured by a tree while fighting a fire near Fort Liard, Northwest Territories. Ryan Gould, 41, died when the firefighting helicopter he was piloting crashed in northern Alberta. Zak Muise, 25, lost his life when his ATV rolled over a steep drop while he fought a B.C. fire.

“This wildfire season has been profoundly awful,” B.C. Premier David Eby said. “We are so grateful to . . . all of our firefighters for their daily heroism. This tragic news reminds us yet again of the extraordinary sacrifices they make to keep us safe.”
As the summer proceeded, so did the number of fires roaring through Canadian forests. Some made the devastating jump into communities, such as Enterprise in the Northwest Territories. The tight-knit hamlet was once a vital service stop and gateway for those entering the North. Now it was a pile of smouldering rubble and ash after a heartbreaking wildfire incinerated 90 per cent of all structures.

Meanwhile, another fire in the Northwest Territories danced dangerously close to the capital city of Yellowknife. Another evacuation order came down — this one on a mega scale — leaving the community akin to a ghost town. Thousands of residents fled the flames and went to Alberta and B.C. via commercial airlines, Canadian Armed Forces aircraft, and special evacuation flights. Hospitals, homeless shelters, seniors’ residences, animal shelters, and jails emptied as part of a massive evacuation plan for 22,000 people.

Most Yellowknife residents, however, drove to safety on the solitary, two-lane highway that eventually heads south, out of town. The drive proved harrowing. Flames roared through hapless trees lining both sides of Highway 3. Fiery embers streaked through the sky, landing on cars, trucks, and campers that snaked along the road in lines of traffic that stretched for miles. Heavy, black smoke turned day to night, obscuring vision, creating chaos, and causing evacuees to wonder if they would survive the fiery journey.

Numerous other NWT communities evacuated residents, too, leaving many people to share stories of trepidation and terror. Yvette Bruneau recalled how she grabbed two packed bags and her two-year-old dog, Speckles, as she left Hay River on Aug. 13. The fire, however, was at its peak as she got on the road.

“I remember driving through there and I drove through flames,” said Bruneau. A thick haze obscured almost all visibility, and it caused Bruneau to drive into a ditch. “I phoned my son and I said, ‘Well, if I don’t make it out, I love you.’ He said, ‘Mom, I love you, too.’” She then told him: “Do not come after me. You will not make it.”

After that call, Bruneau climbed up a nearby hill with her dog and waved her arms frantically while yelling “Please help me! Please save me!” A passerby stopped to rescue her as well as another driver whose vehicle had also hit the ditch.

“I’m blessed that I’m alive,” said Bruneau.

British Columbia saw wildfires take a wicked turn in August. The province had already broken its record for most area burned during a wildfire season by the middle of July. More than 1.4 million hectares (3.5 million acres) were scorched, beating the 1.35 million hectares (3.3 million acres) that had burned during the entirety of the 2018 season.

A new ferocity in the flames left people gasping. With heat blasts and high winds whipping up embers, up to 500 active fires blazed across the province on some days.

Most foreboding, perhaps, was the Donnie Creek fire. It became the largest fire to ever strike B.C., the culmination of eight smaller blazes joining together in an incendiary demonstration of their power. By mid-August, the Donnie Creek fire had devoured an area of land bigger than the entire province of Prince Edward Island.

A different wildfire, however, instilled the greatest fear. The McDougall Creek wildfire terrorized thousands in West Kelowna, ultimately razing about 189 homes and causing the evacuation of thousands. Firefighters said they’d never seen anything quite like those fast-moving flames.

“It was a devastating night last night, probably one of the toughest of my career — the toughest of all our firefighters’ careers likely,” West Kelowna fire chief Jason Brolund said after the first hours of fighting the blaze in the city. “It was one of the most challenging nights of firefighting in our history . . . We fought 100 years’ worth of fires — all in one night.”

And the nightmare wasn’t over.

“We may have another scary night tonight,” Brolund warned. He was right. It took several long days before the fire — which could take months to completely extinguish — was chased out of the city.

Residents evacuated West Kelowna, many to the city of Kelowna on the opposite side of Okanagan Lake. From the shores, people watched flames march down the hillside and annihilate neighbourhoods in their hometown.

“We stood in (a) parking lot for three hours and we watched everything burn,” one West Kelowna resident, Elizabeth Twyman, said through tears.

“We just watched as the flames came down farther and farther,” added her next-door neighbour Tiffany Genge. Unable to believe their eyes, they borrowed a pair of binoculars from someone nearby.

“Elizabeth looked through them, put the binoculars down, looked at me and just started crying,” recalled Genge. “She said, ‘It’s gone. It’s all gone.’”

Wildfire unfurled more fury in B.C. as August became filled with crisis after crisis. Fire began roaring through the Shuswap, a popular four-season destination dotted with idyllic communities, shady forests, and pristine waterways. The Bush Creek East wildfire viciously swept through the area, taking an estimated 168 structures, including many homes. Officials with the Columbia Shuswap Regional District called the blaze “devastating,” noting it also knocked out hundreds of power poles and lines.

Many residents defied an evacuation order, staying to protect their property. When others tried to cross a roadblock into the evacuated area to take supplies to those residents who stayed behind, a confrontation occurred with RCMP.

Tempers flared along with the flames. The residents’ actions attracted both criticism and support. Many understood their desire to try to save their homes, while others questioned if the residents’ decision to stay would create additional problems if at some point they needed rescuing. The BC Wildfire Service also expressed concern that firefighting equipment — pumps, sprinklers, hoses, and ATVs — had been moved or stolen, because some residents believed they had a better idea of how that equipment should be utilized. The residents and fire personnel eventually began working together to battle the blaze.

The highly charged atmosphere proved no surprise. Dealing with wildfires frayed the nerves of many. Evacuees from B.C. and the Northwest Territories grew tired, wondering when they could return home. Understandably heated remarks from NWT Premier Caroline Cochrane reflected that emotion as she visited evacuees staying in Calgary. Cochrane said she’d been asking for better roads and communication technologies to enhance safety for NWT residents for years.

“I’m tired. I’ve been tired for a long time for asking for infrastructure,” Cochrane said. “And now I’m angry.”
